Package chaincfg defines chain configuration parameters for BTC and PKT
Cash networks and provides the ability to define additional custom networks.

Although this package was primarily written for btcd and adapted to pktd, it
has intentionally been designed so it can be used as a standalone package for
any projects needing to use parameters for the standard Bitcoin networks or
for projects needing to define their own network.
