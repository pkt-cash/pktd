Package connmgr implements a generic Bitcoin network connection manager.

## Overview

Connection Manager handles all the general connection concerns such as
maintaining a set number of outbound connections, sourcing peers, banning,
limiting max connections, etc.

The package provides a generic connection manager which is able to accept
connection requests from a source or a set of given addresses, dial them and
notify the caller on connections. The main intended use is to initialize a pool
of active connections and maintain them to remain connected to the P2P network.

In addition the connection manager provides the following utilities:

- Notifications on connections or disconnections
- Handle failures and retry new addresses from the source
- Connect only to specified addresses
- Permanent connections with increasing backoff retry timers
- Disconnect or Remove an established connection
