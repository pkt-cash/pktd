Package hdkeychain provides an API for bitcoin hierarchical deterministic
extended keys (BIP0032).

## Feature Overview

- Full BIP0032 implementation
- Single type for private and public extended keys
- Convenient cryptograpically secure seed generation
- Simple creation of master nodes
- Support for multi-layer derivation
- Easy serialization and deserialization for both private and public extended
  keys
- Support for custom networks by registering them with chaincfg
- Obtaining the underlying EC pubkeys, EC privkeys, and associated bitcoin
  addresses ties in seamlessly with existing btcec and btcutil types which
  provide powerful tools for working with them to do things like sign
  transitions and generate payment scripts
- Uses the btcec package which is highly optimized for secp256k1
- Code examples including:
  - Generating a cryptographically secure random seed and deriving a
    master node from it
  - Default HD wallet layout as described by BIP0032
  - Audits use case as described by BIP0032
- Comprehensive test coverage including the BIP0032 test vectors
- Benchmarks
