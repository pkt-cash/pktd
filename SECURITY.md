# Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

Request that PKT users who may have potentially sensitive
security vulnerabilities to report do so in a way that is 
responsible, responsible, and (hopefully) confidential.

See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsible_disclosure
Also: https://www.w3.org/TeamSubmission/sdbp/

A policy should have some guidelines to keep users informed
of what to expect after they make contact with us, and define
reasonable expectations; for example, how often they might
expect to get an updates, what to expect if their reported
vulnerability declined, etc.
